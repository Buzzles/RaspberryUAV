# RaspberryUAV

###Raspberry Pi based UAV Project.

Project is really an R&D/Learning experiment, reaching a self hovering drone is the end goal. Not intended to be a fully functioning all singing, all dancing uav project. 

######Plan:
* Design T-Copter Frame
* Investigate ducted fan design for easier gimballing on front two motors
* Design motor mounts based on above. Potentially consider seperating prop and motor via drive shaft.
* Aquire a pi-zero, load one of the real time os distros onto it.
* Continue working on gpio library, build into flight library
* Create basic pid functionality for auto hover.
* Create basic rx/tx protocol and support for really simple commands.
* Attach small ultrasonic sensor to support landing and hovering.
